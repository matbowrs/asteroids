# Asteroids
A simple implementation of Asteroids using Python and the boot.dev course on Python OOP.

## Ideas to extend the game (taken from boot.dev, added to the README to not forget about)
Add a scoring system
Implement multiple lives and respawning
Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
Add acceleration to the player movement
Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
Add a background image
Create different weapon types
Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
Add a shield power-up
Add a speed power-up
Add bombs that can be dropped
